# GOARCH doesn't have a default value to allow the binary to be built according to the host where the command
# was called. For example, if we call `make docker-build-netmon` in a local env which has the Apple Silicon M1 SO
# the docker BUILDPLATFORM arg will be linux/arm64 when for Apple x86 it will be linux/amd64. Therefore,
# by leaving it empty we can ensure that the container and binary shipped on it will have the same platform.
